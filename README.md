# Reef Aquarium Species REST API (ASP.NET Core MVC)

#### Various species of fish, corals, and invertebrates exist that are often sought after within the saltwater aquarium hobby. In order to ensure that they are properly taken care of, it is important to have a thorough understanding of each species' care requirements.

#### This is the first, unpolished version of a personal project that I am working on which will simultaneously help me learn and practice various web development concepts. In the next version, I will refine upon what already exists for this web app. I would like to polish the overall design of the website, enable docker support, test API endpoints, and make use of Data Transfer Objects (DTOs).

## Information

#### ASP.NET Core was used to create this web application.

### The following concepts were learnt and applied:
> - Building a REST API
> - C# and its .NET Core framework
> - Model View Controller design/architectual pattern
> - Implementing CRUD functionality

#### More specifically, I made use of the following:
> - Dependency injection
> - Repository design pattern
> - SQL Server
> - DAO database setup
> - RESTful API guidelines
> - HTTP (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, status codes)
> - Views (Razor, Shared Layout, ViewBag, RenderSection)
